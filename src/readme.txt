How does the game work?

1) You have to reveal as many cells as possible without clicking on a bomb
2) There are 20 bombs on the board
3) When you click on a cell to reveal it you will either see a number, blank cell or a mine
4) The number that is displayed when you click is to show you how far a bomb is from your current cell
5) You win the game when the "Non-Mines" is at 0

Good luck, have fun!
